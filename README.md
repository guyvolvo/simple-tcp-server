A lightweight TCP Server built with Python's native socket library and improved with asyncio. This project helped me understand the core fundamentals of network programming.

**The server should follow a straightforward process:**
- Attaches itself to a specific IP(localhost) and Port(I chose 8000) (127.0.0.1:8000).
- Waits for an incoming connection.
- Opens the door for a client to join.
- Reads the incoming data and sends it back.
- Closes that connection

I will be using telnet to connect to the server with the windows terminal
